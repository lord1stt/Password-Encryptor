In short, this project allows you to make your passwords more protected against possible hacking attacks. 

It replaces the characters in your password according to a certain algorithm. This makes it difficult for others to crack your password.

So how does this algorithm work? I'll explain right away.

Let's assume that after the user enters his password into the program, we assign numbers to all characters of the password, starting from the left, starting from 1. The algorithm puts the characters whose numbers are prime numbers at the beginning in order, and writes the rest after them as is.

Ultimately, the user gets a stronger, more secure version of a password they normally use.

Sorry for the directory name :( 
It should have been "Password Encryptor" :)
